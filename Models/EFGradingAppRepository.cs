        //README BEFORE EDITING
        //Each Team (1-15) has 4 Methods that have been created here.

        //These are basic structures that each team may use for their individual purposes. 
        //For example: Method 1 - ADD, Method 2 - EDIT, Method 3 - DELETE, Method 4 - RETURN BY ID (etc.)

        //You may modify the return type, the method parameters, and then the _context variable as needed. Do not edit the context file itself. 
        //If you choose to modify those things you MUST also CHANGE where that method is referenced in the "IGradingAppRepository" to match what you changed

        //You may change the Method names, however, you must make sure the Interface matches what you change with the method. 

        //Please be careful when editing and adding methods as this will easily break the GradingApp
